player that want to play place their bets , dealer has count down to lock the bets once first bet is placed allowing any 
other player to also place the bet

- buy in minimun bet, these are integer dollars -> for the mvp all players get same amount
    -  state is local to the game session , dealer has unlimited money
    -  players money is tracked , as players run out of money they become inactive but still get game informtion broadcasted

- all players get a card  one by one those who placed the bet, this deck is 52 cards, each new iteration of bets gets a fresh deck,
    - this allows players to use some probaility as a strategy based on what cards other users have as cards
    - front end can simulate the suffling of the deck and add animation such as removing the joker

- first card of dealer is face down so it is not send to other player but second card is shown to players


- order of card distribution is determined by the order in which the players join for mvp

- once players have all cards, game expects stay or hit messages

    - hit -> players can go up to 21, auto lose if over 21 , take their money
    - stay -> players can choose not to obtain new cars, then goin in waiting state unitl everyone else finished hitting

- dealer card is broadcasted to players , if total of both cards is lower then 17 they have to hit 
    - if dealer gets 21 then all players lose who dont also have 21
    - any players who have same total as dealer get their money back
    - if 21 and dealer does not have 21 then 3 chips for 2 chips

- payout is the same amount you bet


- card complexity, splitting , doubling down after seeing one card credits anohter hit
